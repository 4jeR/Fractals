# Fractals
Simple project written in C++ using SFML library to generate fractals.

Made in collaboration with:

[Havman](https://github.com/Havman "Igor Półchłopek")

[Baczyn](https://github.com/Baczyn "Mikołaj Baczyński")


It's the basic animation which allows the user to see every of the seven different fractals-types implemented.
